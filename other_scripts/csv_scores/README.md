what if scores are in csv format?
we need a program to add them up!

## How to use
+ Copy example csv to another file for example `hw1.csv`
+ Fill new csv file
+ Run script like this:
```bash
./sum.py ./hw1.csv 
```
+ For multiple files you can run:
```bash
./sum.py ./hw1.csv ./hw2.csv /path/to/other/file.csv
```
